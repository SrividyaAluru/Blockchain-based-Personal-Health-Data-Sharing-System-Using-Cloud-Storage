# Facilitating sharing of data using blockchain.

By this project, we tried to implement the paper : [Blockchain-based Personal Health Data Sharing System Using Cloud Storage.]
### Abstract 
With the advent of rapid development of wearable
technology and mobile computing, huge amount of personal
health-related data is being generated and accumulated on
continuous basis at every moment. This research work proposes a conceptual design for sharing personal continuous-
dynamic health data using blockchain technology supplemented
by cloud storage to share the health-related information in a
secure and transparent manner.



## EXECUTION GUIDE
* Open terminal in the source path and type "python BlockChain.py"
* Read the demo pdf file to get a good idea about the flow of the execution and execute accordingly.

# create_Block():
* Block.py is the object descriptor for Block and the constructor creates the Block.(Block.py line 6).

# verify_transactions():
* Transactions.py is object descriptor for Transactions and one of the methods of Transaction is 
verify_transaction.(Transaction.py line 13)  

# mineBlock():
* Block.py is object descriptor for Block and mine_block() is onr of the methods of the class.
(Block.py line 29)

# viewUser():
* User.py is object descriptor for User and view_user() is one of the methods of the class.(User.py line 14)# Blockchain-based-Personal-Health-Data-Sharing-System-Using-Cloud-Storage
